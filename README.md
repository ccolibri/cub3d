# cub3D
**Project for School 21**

This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90â€™s game, which was the first FPS ever.

This is about a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way.

Also, this is my first raycaster with miniLibX.

**Installation and run:**

```https://github.com/ccolibri/cub3d.git```

```cd cub3D```

```make run``` **(to run mandatory version)**

```make runbonus``` **(to run bonus version with sound inside)**

You can read the [en.subject.pdf](https://github.com/ccolibri/cub3d/blob/master/cub3d/en.subject.pdf) to see all instructions to create this project.
